My first real project! I love games, and at the time I was deep into [Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/). Naturally, the first thing to do with my newfound coding skills was to try and recreate the turn-based system of a card game made by a successful games company. I chose Halo for the theme as it is the first game series that I really loved. I built it with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learn more about the fundamentals of a website.
