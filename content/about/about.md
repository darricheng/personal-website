I got my first taste of programming on my first job at a startup. I enjoyed it enough to commit myself to a full career switch with a course from General Assembly. However, I was not prepared for the overflowing interest and passion that was to follow shortly after.

I think there are three main reasons why I love software:

1. I love the feeling of empowerment that software gives me. With my skills, I can create real solutions to real problems that people face in this world, starting with solving problems that I face.
2. I also have an innate curiousity and desire to learn. I find myself being curious about how things work, and I like to dig deep to build up my knowledge of the inner workings of things from the bottom up. In this sense, computers and software is perfect for me. Being an ever-growing field, I find that there will always be something new to learn no matter how much I learn.
3. I just find it so cool! I live mostly in the terminal when I do my software work now, and it is a world that has continued to amaze me time and time again. I switched to using Neovim as my IDE shortly before starting to work professionally as an SWE, and the powers of Vim just wow me again and again. Similarly, there is an endless number of CLI tools that I want to dive deeper into, so that I can spend hours optimising workflows that would take mere minutes of repetitive keystrokes.

Knowing what I know now, I wish I had started learning about software sooner! But life is a journey, and it is the discoveries that we make along the way that make this journey interesting. I'm still on the starting leg of my journey, and I have plenty more to learn. Check out my [blog](/posts) to read about some of my learnings.
